==== SMALL ====
-- World should really have a vec3, so not just a float height
===============

==== MODERATE ====
-- LOG_DESTROYS should print actual IDs (addresses) for ease of debugging with validation layers
==================

==== BIG ====
?? Allow proper specifyEntitiesToRender: switch from descriptorSet_textures_1 in HmlRenderer to descriptorSet_textures_1_perImage in HmlDeferredRenderer, but implement an automatic system to track update progress to check what frame we are at (and thus which DescriptorSet can be updated).
?? Implement a resource-tracking system. This would allow to have a single pair of DescriptorSet--Resource; upon needing to update the Resource we would mark the old pair as to-be-deleted and create and start using a new pair. (useful for static resources).
=============

==== OPTIMIZATION ====
-- Create a custom queue for a circular buffer OR learn how to use and pass a custom allocator to queues.
