==== SMALL ====
-- Make normals VK_FORMAT_R16G16B16A16_SFLOAT. Maybe touch positions
-- gBufferLightSpacePositions can be reduced because for light??
-- Check cull mode everywhere and try performance for insatnces
-- Using LAYOUT_UNDEFINED seems to hinder performance when we actually know the layout
-- preFunc ability
===============

==== MODERATE ====
-- World should really have a vec3, so not just a float height
-- HmlContext should be passed to super-constructor
-- Replace queue with a custom curcular buffer OR just insert the appropriate allocator to queues.
==================


==== BIG ====
-- Allow proper specifyEntitiesToRender: switch from descriptorSet_textures_1 in HmlRenderer to descriptorSet_textures_1_perImage in HmlDeferredRenderer, but implement an automatic system to track update progress to check what frame we are at (and thus which DescriptorSet can be updated).
-- We need only 1 pipeline per RenderPass for HmlTerrainRenderer, but we end up creating an array of 2 for each. Rething the pipeline storage architecture.
-- Implement a resource-tracking system. This would allow to have a single pair of DescriptorSet--Resource; upon needing to update the Resource we would mark the old pair as to-be-deleted and create and start using a new pair. (useful for static resources).
